# 🔐 Simple Keylogger – Prodigy InfoTech Internship (Task-03)

This is a basic Python keylogger developed as part of my **Cybersecurity Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.

## 📌 Features
- Captures every key typed on the keyboard
- Saves logged keys to a file `keylog.txt`
- Stops logging when the `Esc` key is pressed

## ⚙️ How It Works
This keylogger uses the `pynput` library to listen to keystrokes. All keys are saved into a local file named `keylog.txt`.

### 📥 Requirements

Install required module using:

```bash
pip install pynput
▶️ Run the Script

python keylogger.py
Then start typing anywhere (Notepad, browser, etc.) and press Esc to stop.
